Phone :

This is a phone which is created as being has number  "1".
NOTE :  Phone number is added to phone frame's title;

Features: 
- Have to press "É…" to move up or press "V" to move down.
- If wanted to write any character which is on buttons to textfield then have to press same button as character's index value times. Within every press time is reseted to 1.5 second.
 (Actually we start by 0 for index when we code but I dont know how to name it so I wrote that. I am sorry if it makes you confusing)
